Dear <<addressee>>,

I am extremely delighted to apply for the <<position_name>> position with <<company_name>>. After seeing the call for applications through the University of Victoria’s DHSI listserv, I could hardly wait to apply.  I should say that an opportunity like this would never have even been on my radar a couple of years ago, but time changes all things and now what I was largely oblivious to has become a goal and aspiration.  I would like to briefly canvas my academic journey so far and hopefully give you both some sense of precisely why working for <<company_name>> is precisely the kind of group I would like to make a part of the next phase in my career.  Coming to join this team would be an absolute dream come true.

I hold a Ph.D. in English from the University of Illinois at Chicago (2010) and have been an Associate Professor and Department Chair of the English and Foreign Languages Department at the University of St. Francis in Joliet, IL for the past three years.  My original doctoral work strikes me now as quite eclectic:  graduate school training was in post-Kantian Continental Philosophy—with a heavy emphasis on Heidegger, Lacan, Levinas, Blanchot, and Derrida—combined with Medieval and Renaissance Literature—largely Chaucer and Shakespeare; I was also fortunate enough to be in a Department that was perfectly fine with me taking courses with physicists who were working on the foundations of quantum mechanics and offering interdisciplinary summer seminars combining physics, architecture, and philosophy together—an English Ph.D. student that got to learn about quantum/non-classical logics was a strange thing.  My mentors and teachers in graduate school gave me a high bar when it came to truly interdisciplinary work—tracing out potential connections between the rigors of analytic philosophy and the wandering peregrinations of an essay by Derrida was hard work (and so often did not ultimately pan out in the ways we wanted).  That said, those same mentors instilled in me a sense and awareness of how incredibly difficult and tough truly interdisciplinary work is at the end of the day.  (Even if I have yet to chart out a career that has succeeded in hitting that high bar, they did wonders in creating a desire for such work.)  Surface-level connections between things, between disciplines, are easy.  As Donald Davidson wrote, speaking about similes, everything in the universe is like everything else, and in many more ways than one—which so often makes life tough.  Deeper connections, analogies, between things—are much harder to come by.  Whatever one might want to call it—similarities that are somehow “structural,” likenesses that arise only when one can think about things often solely in terms of “form” (a career or set of courses where one does little more than read the likes of Freud and Lacan can help immensely with cultivating this capacity to think about “form”), correspondences that a well-constructed metaphor can bring out into the open—all of these kinds of skills and capacities are what one gets when they chase real interdisciplinary work and thought.

So, one might say that the previous paragraph charts a fairly typical academic journey and, naturally, one might wonder how the more “Digital Humanities”-side of this position fits into such a path.  It is true, I think that teaching at a small, Catholic, liberal arts school has given me a nice set of tools with which to engage in interdisciplinary work in general.  Without a doubt, faculty at small schools often need to be incredibly flexible, adaptable; in addition to my original areas of study I have picked up and added expertise in areas like Young Adult Literature, ecocriticism and environmental philosophy, and, most recently (and most relevantly for the advertised position), an ever-increasing knowledge of work in the Digital Humanities.  This last area has grown quite a bit over the past year (I caught the DH bug at a joint [DHRI](https://dhsouthbend.org/dhri/dhri-2019/) between Notre Dame and Saint Mary’s College and have been quite hooked ever since) as I worked my way through full paths devoted to data analytics and data science through [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/), which I have found to be incredibly enjoyable—it’s been years since I took courses in linear algebra as an undergraduate, but some of it comes back to me little by little—and all of the ways in which learning to code and to include a more computational way of thinking has greatly enlarged my intellectual repertoire.  I often have students—especially those who cross my path at the Gen Ed level—confess their surprise when it turns out that, regardless of their major, I have some bit of learning within that area I can use to communicate with them.  This was leveraged quite strongly by a former Provost of USF who was extremely supportive of an initiative—spearheaded by myself and a fellow English Department colleague—to put together a Digital Humanities degree.  As many know, the field of DH has made wonderful headway into our arena, but, still, it is headway made mostly at the graduate level.  Institutions that offer B.A. degrees in the Digital Humanities are still few and far between (although we all no doubt know that the future may be one where such a degree becomes a staple at every institution of higher learning).  My colleague came to USF with a background in Digital Rhetoric and Composition, Digital Media Studies, and other similar areas; she was quite naturally drawn to this project for reasons that had much to do with the design side of DH.  I, myself, am always on the lookout for new things to learn—and so I gravitated to slightly different areas with this field than my colleague.  Wanting to diversify between the two of us, I have spent time learning the more statistical and computational side of things—focusing on learning to code in Python, working on pet projects focused on Natural Language Processing, data visualization, sentiment analysis of social media platforms, machine learning (to a tiny degree so far), learning a little bit of the [Hugo framework](http://gohugo.io/) (which started from [a Programming Historian lesson](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages), actually, which led to my creation of my own static [DH blog](https://kspicer80.github.io/)) along with learning some JS and Go, with brief forays into work currently being done through the [Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)](https://tei-c.org/), and much more.

As usual for one learning all kinds of new digital tools, much of the work of applying this knowledge grew out of very specific problems and concerns that I had as a teacher.  I run, every semester, an extremely well-received Gen Ed course on literature centered on what many call “Weird Fiction” (a genre that includes the likes of M. R. James, Lovecraft, Stephen King, and many more).  I refined a rather extensive technique of student feedback given each week in response to work they do on our Canvas discussion boards.  After learning a bit of Markdown and wanting to be able to work on providing this feedback by first working offline, I set myself a very simple task of learning how to work with Instructure’s API (through a wonderful little open source Python module called [CanvasApi](https://canvasapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)) so that I could compose all of my weekly responses to students in a simple plain text file (the work of [Dennis Tenen](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown) on plain text composition was incredibly influential on me) and then fully automate the uploading of said comments along with grades for each assignment through a simple Python script.  Gone were the days of copying and pasting my responses to each student; gone were the days of losing a really extensive response to a student because my internet went down or the browser crashed, etc.  Given all that the pandemic has forced upon us educators, I have had faculty colleagues eager to see how all of this works—largely with the hopes of wanting to reproduce the really rich and powerful discussions about literature that my students have in this course.  A huge part of it is the faculty feedback—and being able to not have to worry so much about the technical sides of things obviously frees faculty (and their time) up for all kinds of other wonderful, far more profoundly significant pedagogical concerns.  As Robby Burns [mentions](https://www.robbyburns.com/blog/eliminating-canvas-stress-by-writing-content-in-markdown), “You go to war with the LMS you have”—obviously, if we ourselves can spend less time going to war with the LMS we have, this is almost always a good thing.  And, to be honest, I wonder if the only real way to avoid having to fight the LMS is by having access to and learning about how our digital infrastructure really works.  As proponents and advocates of open-source software love to say, being able to get “under the hood,” so to speak, of our digital software while having some sense of what one’s looking at once one gets the hood open, provides one with infinite possibilities.  Prior to putting together this Digital Humanities program, prior to learning how to code and write simple Python scripts, I was often at war with the LMS; today, I fight the LMS quite a bit less:  now I head for the documentation and solve problems myself with a degree of autonomy that I didn’t really even know was possible.  Now even much more mundane tasks—structuring my Department’s Assessment data (making sure I have all the metadata I need in the right spots with all the scripts pulling from one centralized location, etc.) so that annual reports become so much smoother to create—is just icing on the cake.  It is nice to be able to write scripts to generate, say, network graphs of my students’ discussion posts—who’s responding to whom, which author/story got talked about the most often each week—and it is quite awesome to be able to write a script to keep track of all of this data spread out over the entire history of the course—a little data wrangling and munging and I can track everything from the length of student posts to how many times (over the past four years or so) the vast majority of students wrote incessantly about a Clive Barker story in Week 14 of the semester.

Now, it is certainly true:  I do lack some of the necessary areas of expertise on the more “digital” side of things.  That said, the position calls for someone “with a high level of natural curiosity, that is eager to learn, and with an inclination to action” and I would like to suggest that the last couple of years has done nothing but demonstrate a profound degree of curiosity and interest, especially when it comes to the whole field of textual analysis, the digital humanities in general, and so on.  In terms of the teaching side of things, it is true that I have spent my career so far crafting and honing my vocation as a teacher.  These efforts have certainly been rewarding in and of themselves, but it was even more so a couple of years ago when I received the University’s “Excellence in Teaching Award,” an honor that came my way almost as soon as I was eligible for it.  (I am always flattered, too, when I have been nominated for this award multiple times since winning—students do not often read the Policy Manual which states that one cannot win multiple times within a certain time frame—many of them have nominated me for it every year anyways).  Students tell me on a daily basis how I have earned a reputation at our small university for being an excellent teacher and ally and supporter of students—word of mouth does a great deal of work at small institutions and my course sections—whether they are in Gen Ed, the Duns Scotus Honors Program at USF, English major courses, or even under the Philosophy and Political Science course listings—are always full and students rarely miss an opportunity to tell their friends to come my way.  I understand that this position would be quite a change for me, but that is something I am more than ready for and incredibly enthusiastic about as we would give me a wonderful opportunity not only to continue honing my computational/programming skills, but also to continuing developing all kinds of capacities I would like to incorporate into my repertoire:  collaborative group work, project management, and so much more.

In the hopes of providing some sense of what I have in the way of these just mentioned skills, I would like to speak to some of my administrative work since receiving tenure—which will also, I hope, speak to my capacities for collaboration, teamwork, etc..  Prior to being promoted to Associate Professor, the priority on my time was in the classroom; this has changed over the last couple of years as I took over the administrative duties of the English Department Chair position.  Although this was quite a transition for someone who originally felt he would live in the classroom if he could, the switch has been rather smooth (admittedly much smoother than it was during my very first year as chair).  Much of my time since being promoted to Associate Professor has been taken up with the construction of a number of different initiatives, improvements to our program, and also a slew of brand-new things as well at both the departmental and university levels.  A couple of years ago I helped design and implement a brand new First-Year Experience sequence for all of our students; long before that I was coordinator for the older “Core” program, which itself had a Great Books feel, of a sort; I put in a great deal of time with one of my colleagues getting a “Writing” concentration added to the English Major, opening up space for interdisciplinary connections between a number of different disciplines in the Humanities.  Over the past year or so I and a colleague also created an eighteen-hour course sequence in Rhetoric and Composition to be offered to high school teachers with MA degrees interested in teaching dual-credit composition courses in high school (Illinois Board of Higher Education guidelines require teachers to have either an MA degree in English or an MA in a different field along with eighteen credit hours in the discipline in order to qualify for dual-credit teaching).  Even more recently than that, over the past year another colleague of mine and I put through our university’s governance a brand new “Digital Humanities” undergraduate major, which will essentially be one of the very first of its kind at the undergraduate level.  Also, after assuming the Chair position in my department, we have seen a sizeable uptick in majors—along with our securing two grants totaling close to $100,000 to help fund a Writing Program Administrator position and also to aid with a couple publishing endeavors connected to USF’s centennial year (which was this past year, in fact).  Last, but by no means least, a dear friend, departmental colleague, and junior faculty member was nominated for and won the “Excellence in Teaching Award” this past April—an honor that is quite significant, given how much focus our university puts on being an absolutely stellar teacher.  This last accomplishment is by far my, our, greatest one—fertile and nurturing soil helps brilliant teachers grow and I am proudest of her winning this award, an enormous honor and one that the three full-time faculty members in my department deserve a good deal of credit for.  They say it takes a village to raise a child—the same can so often be said of good departments caring for the growth of teachers:  stellar teachers are a departmental/group effort, every single step of the way.

In terms of leadership when it comes to interdisciplinary work, I have worked a great deal to push beyond certain disciplinary boundaries.  No doubt:  academia does seem to possess—as I am sure we all know—a problematic tendency towards siloes.  What is the solution?  Is the solution to tear the siloes down, reduce their number, pretend they are not there, build the siloes even bigger such that they consume one another and just get lumped into one gigantic silo?  Or is it useless to fight against them in the first place?  A few years ago, Stéphanie Walsh Matthews of Ryerson University gave a [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNqoLybBIjs&t=277s) about the need for interdisciplinary work.  Matthews herself has a Ph.D. in French, but works with computer engineers and experts in robotics to design robots that they hope can help children with Autism Spectrum Disorders.   As she put it in her talk, if the world actually worked in a way where we could easily carve it up into nice and neat and tidy boxes, then the silo model would be ideal—however, as we all know, “we don’t really have” such a world.  Matthews argues that “the more you can embrace and allow yourself to step just outside of the particular rules of a discipline you end up engaging and a lot.”   Matthews’s talk is one of the greatest I have ever come across in terms of arguing for the kind of collaborative and interdisciplinary work that I like to continue to strive for each and every day.  What I like best about her argument is not how she herself is an example of the kind of interdisciplinary work I want all of us to do more of:  take a dash of a Ph.D. in languages, combine it with some folks that know how to program computers and robots, and you get a fascinating and wonderful recipe—a project that helps us learn to better care for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder while adding to our knowledge about Autism.  That is all fantastic, but what I really love is her central claim that what interdisciplinary work really helps you do is cultivate humility.  When you are in a room with all kinds of people that have content expertise in all kinds of areas that you do not, humility needs to be central to how one works in such a space.  I have worked under far too many leaders, sad to say, who step into a room already absolutely certain they know what the proper course of action is—very little humility is on display.  Good interdisciplinary work is hard—it does not come easily, but this cultivation of humility is an enormously necessary quality.

Matthews’s vision of interdisciplinary collaboration suggests that we should want to work with people who live and move between different siloes, who can speak multiple languages and utilize multiple logics simultaneously; I want to work with individuals who can bridge the distances between siloes.  I do not need collaborators that each have Ph.Ds. in twelve different areas, but I do want to work with people who know how to partner with and leverage the expertise of twelve different people with different areas of focus and expertise—and what that requires of the one who leverages (or who helps to leverage) all this is, no doubt, a profound sense of humility.  As Matthews’s notes, if the world is as complex and multifaceted as we all know it is, then it is foolhardy to get everyone in their neat and tidy little boxes—the problems one needs to solve are significant and complex—people in siloes probably will not be able to cut it.  We all know how significant an ability to code is for humanists.[^1] <<company_name>> is on the cutting edge of this need and it is clear that the need here is only going to increase in the future.  I cannot even begin to say how significant I think what the Constellate Team is doing for all of us who do not come from the hard sciences.  I greatly look forward not only to working with all the different people from different backgrounds and also growing my own knowledge base within this field while simultaneously helping to bring even more scholars into the fold.

I would like to begin concluding by saying that—in all honesty—coming to <<company_name>> would be an enormous game-changer for my ever-increasing knowledge of the DH field.  Would I be punching way too high above my weight class, as it were?  Perhaps—it is true that I have honed my talents at a small liberal arts school.  As previously intimated, I know that my interest and passion for learning more and more of the “digital”/“computational” side of things is not a fad and is not a passing fancy. (I should also mention that a great deal of my learning in this field has leaned incredibly heavily on individuals who are in some way connected to ITHAKA and the TAPI:  I have gained so much knowledge of applying computational methods to humanities-related materials by working off of things done by Dr. William Mattingly [my blog work makes this very clear, I should note, as I have taken his work on machine learning and TensorFlow, spaCy for NLP work, and much, much more to apply to all kinds of different use cases], Melanie Walsh [especially here really wonderful [Introduction to Cultural Analytics and Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html), Nathan Kelber, and many others.)  I love to learn new things (no doubt this was as good a reason as any to stick around and fashion a career in academia) and I know that more and more of my time is, hopefully, going to be spent honing all of these new skills I am acquiring.  I have already seen incredibly clear ways in which learning how to code as a quite “different way of thinking” has expanded into other facets of my own intellectual growth—I have found that it is quite true that the kinds of thinking required in learning how to code do indeed enhance things that all teachers love:  [critical thinking](https://learningdaily.dev/how-critical-thinking-can-help-you-learn-to-code-4421c0849796), problem solving, and so much, much more.  I think a place like ITHAKA might be wonderful for me not only as a teacher and a scholar working across a wide range of disciplines, but also as a perennial and lifelong learner.  What a dream come true it would be to be a part of it.

I am looking for a change of pace in my career and would love to transition to something different and new.  I am anxious and excited and enthusiastic for trying something new—and I am very excited to think about how heading to the ITHAKA will undoubtedly make by skills sharper and much more robust.  Do I have all of the prerequisites and qualifications required for this position, perhaps not—there is, admittedly, still so much I need to learn.  But I have a desire and drive to get my feet more strongly planted in this new field of study—and thus I have a profound quantity of motivation that I am not sure other applicants could quite match.

With this letter, please find included my CV.  I thank you both so much for your attention to and consideration of my application.

[^1]: I am also aware, as James Bridle notes very clearly and convincingly in his _New Dark Age:  Technology and the End of the Future_ (London: Verso, 2019), that coding knowledge is necessary but not sufficient:  “Learning to code is not enough, just as learning to plumb a sink is not enough to understand the complex interactions between water tables, political geography, ageing infrastructure, and social policy that define, shape, and produce actual life support systems in society” (3). Humanists are perfectly trained and well-prepared to engage with some of these larger issues connected with the digital world more generally.
